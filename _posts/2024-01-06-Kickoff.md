Today, the 2024 FIRST Robotics Competition challenge, "Crescendo," was released to all worldwide FRC teams. Our team watched the Crescendo game animation video by Haas and brainstormed ideas for the robot. We had lunch kindly provided by the team members' parents, and went straight to work. The team talked about the rules for this year's challenge and discussed strategies for building a winning robot. 

The team has grown a lot this year and we are excited to gain new ideas and perspectives to improve our brainstorming.
