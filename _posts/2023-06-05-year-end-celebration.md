The Devilbotz wrapped up our 2022-2023 FRC season with an end-of-year celebration, where we invited students, parents, mentors, and School Board members to highlight our work over the course of the past season. There were lots of great snacks, and our slideshow was projected along with videos of our competitions.

We showcased our robot to school committee members -- who have now pledged to support our team in the coming competition seasons -- as well as current eight graders, many of whom are interested in joining our team during the 2023-2024 FRC season.

We also celebrated and recognized each of our mentors, as they volunteer countless hours of their time in assisting the team.

Finally, we celebrated our seniors, some of whom have spent all four years of their high school career with 2876 Robotics. Each senior was awarded a custom plaque for their dedication to the team. Congratulations to our seniors for successfully completing their time at BHS! We wish them the best of luck as they navigate their post-secondary plans.
