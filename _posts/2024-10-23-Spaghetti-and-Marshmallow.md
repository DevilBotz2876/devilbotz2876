Our second team-building activity of the year was spaghetti and marshmallows towers for our new members. The people on the business team set up plastic bags filled with the supplies they needed to hand out to the teams. Each team had 15 minutes to attempt to assemble the tallest tower using the supplies. 

We had a total of five teams with five to eight people on each team. Each team had a different strategy and tactic for how they intended to build their tower. One team's strategy was to try and build a rectangle or square while other teams tried to build by sticking the spaghetti into the marshmallows. Most teams thought it was a great idea and were able to build a tower effectively.
