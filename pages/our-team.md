    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>In 2009, we entered the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) in hopes of building the foundation of our small but growing robotics team. FRC is a robotics competition in which many countries participate and compete with <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/community/inspire/enduring-legacy-of-gracious-professionalism">Gracious Professionalism®</a>. As the FRC season started in January, the team, along with other teams who compete in FRC, kicked into top gear. Every day was a commitment to meet the deadline. During last year's competition, we competed against 40 other robotics teams. We won some and we lost some but it's the journey we took, the knowledge that we gained, the friends we made, and the fun we had that counts.</p>
    <p>We also have participated in competitions that include FTC, Science Olympiad, and the VEX Bridge Battle. We came in second and got an award for most versatile at the Boston University Vex Bridge Battle Competition in 2008. Although we have committed to the FRC, we may be interested in doing other competitions during post-season.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <h3>Mechanical:</h3>
    <p>The Mechanical Division is responsible for fabricating the "meat and bones" of our robot. This division makes up the largest portion of our team. Using wrenches, screws, clamps, nuts, bolts, drills, and saws, Mechanical manipulates motors and metal in order to make a robot that completes a task set for us by FIRST. They do lots of hands-on work, always trying to make the best robot possible. During competitions, Mechanical fixes any damage the robot might have sustained during the match. Even when designs fail, the Mechanical Division keeps working until they find a solution.</p>

    <h3>Electrical:</h3>
    <p>The Electrical Division is responsible for wiring the "nerves" of our robot. They create the board with all of the electrical connections required for the robot to function. Soldering, stripping, and crimping wires is what these guys do best. They work closely with Programming in order to generate ideas for sensors for the robot as well as troubleshooting robot malfunctions. They constantly confirm secure wire connections and replace the robot's battery during competition to ensure peak performance. Electrical is always around to help the robot work as intended.</p>

    <h3>Programming:</h3>
    <p>In essence, the Programming Division makes the robot come to life. Using the coding language Java and a wide variety of sensors, Programming gives the robot a brain. They also fine-tune problems with the robot physically that are too meticulous for Mechanical and Electrical to fix. In the pits, Programming tests the robot's mechanism to ensure correct function. Programming also works closely with Drive Teams in order to map out controls for driving the robot. Programming gives the robot the finishing touch that it needs to be competition ready.</p>

    <h3>CAD:</h3>
    <p>The Computer-Aided Design (CAD) Division is tasked with designing and testing the robot using the CAD software Onshape. CAD is the primary way designers blueprint the robot for fabrication. They set up models to determine dimensions, movement, and plan for how different robot components interact. They keep track of the step-by-step design of the robot. CAD then publicizes their designs so that the entire team as well as the public can view. CAD gives everyone on the team a clear picture of what the robot is going to be.</p>

    <h3>Competition:</h3>
    <p>The Competition Division keeps track of the team's strategy. They start the season by understanding all of the facets of the game. This includes scoring methods, rules, and robot design regulations. Competition also makes up the Drive Teams for the season. They scout other teams during matches to determine the capabilities and strategies of other robots. Finally, Competition determines strategies for our alliance during playoffs. They are the glue that holds together our team for success in events.</p>

    <h3>Business:</h3>
    <p>The Business Division is arguably the most diverse subdivision within the team. They arrange food donations, write and maintain the blog, and talk to sponsors, among other things. They manage sponsorships and donations which keep our team running. This doesn't necessarily mean monetary donations, however. There are many ways companies support our team, and any form of support is appreciated. Donations received are always put to good use. We plan out what we do with money to ensure that it is spent in the most beneficial and responsible ways possible. Monetary donations go toward buying products, registration fees for district competitions and championships, community outreach, pit design, and covering the cost of the annual robot. It helps the team to develop better robots and expand our outreach with our own community as well as others. We also use sponsorship money for traveling and lodging fees when we go to competitions. All of the sponsorship support is greatly appreciated and allows us to develop and improve our team, as well as expand outreach for future STEM leaders.</p>
