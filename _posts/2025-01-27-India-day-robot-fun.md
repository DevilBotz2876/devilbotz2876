India day was a day where many companies set up their booths in the hallways of Burlington High School and promoted their products by offering or selling goodies to gain new customers. Our goal was similar: we wanted to enlighten the community about our robotics team. To do so, we offered a wooden robot for kids to build as we informed the parents about what we do and how we need to do it. Some parents donated money to us and others encouraged their kids to talk to us and ask us questions. Kids loved to color in their robots and learn how to assemble them, learning about how pulling one string moves both the arms and legs of the robot. To us, our effort was worth it. We loved to see the smiles on the kids' faces as they made their new robot friends!
