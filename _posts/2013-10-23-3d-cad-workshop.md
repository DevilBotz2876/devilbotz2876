On November 16th, Team 2876 will be hosting a PTC Workshop, hosted by one of our very own mentors, and PTC employee, Scott Morris. This event is free, and will be hosted in the Lower Library of Burlington High School from 8:30am to 2:00pm. The workshop will, in Scott’s words, “help your team improve their overall design process and shorten the time required to make ‘smart’ design decisions.” It’ll also be “fun!”

This event is open to all members of a FRC or FTC team who would like to attend.

The software we will be using for the workshop is Creo 2.0. We have 30 laptops with the software available, courtesy of PTC, but if you want to, feel free to bring your own laptop.

Lunch will be provided courtesy of <a href="http://www.bgood.com/" target="_blank">b.good</a>, and consists of a burger of your choice (beef or veggie). However, you are free to bring your own lunch if you would like to do so.  Parents, the Burlington Mall is just a couple of miles from the school, if you would like to pass the time doing some holiday shopping.
