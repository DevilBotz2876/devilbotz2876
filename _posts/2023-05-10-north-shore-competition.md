After competing in an exciting Week 1 at Granite State, our team took their talents to Week 3's North Shore event in Reading, MA during March 17-19. Here, we scored a total of 17 ranking points that contributed to our overall New England region rank and ended with a final record of 7 wins and 8 losses. Ranking points are determined by win to loss ratio as well as certain tasks completed within the game matches themselves. Our team heavily focused on scoring as many ranking points as possible, which meant collaboration with other teams to ensure wins. Out of 32 teams at the event, 24 made it to the playoff phase, and our determination led us to being selected by an alliance. With our teammates, we made it as far as the second round of the semifinals. 

After this event, our team was uncertain whether we would be selected for the New England Districts Championships, as we were on the verge of qualifying but unsure of whether we would retain this position after two more weeks' of competition. Teams are limited to two weeks of competition to qualify for the District Championships, and as we had finished our second competition in Week 3, there were still two more weeks to go, and teams who had not competed in their second competition but were still in range of qualifying had the opportunity to overtake our position.

The video below shows our second match of the playoffs.
