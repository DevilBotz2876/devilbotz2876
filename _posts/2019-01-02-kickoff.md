We're organizing and planning the day with two other teams (yay Billerica and Tewksbury!) to watch Kick-off this Saturday, Jan 5, 2019. Then, students will study the competition manual and begin strategizing how to build a brand new, unique robot to compete in *Destination Deep Space* <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/uploads/2019/01/FIRST-DestDeepSpace-logo_full-color-sponsor-350.png"><img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/uploads/2019/01/FIRST-DestDeepSpace-logo_full-color-sponsor-350.png" alt="Destination Deep Space" class="size-full wp-image-2107" class= "center" data-fancybox /></a>
