Today, the members of the Business team have worked hard to accomplish their goals. With competition coming around soon the Business team has been working on various project and tasks to benefit the team.

One of the big things they have done today is making buttons! Making buttons is a big part of what they do. Each year they make new meme buttons designs and spend a few weeks making them so they can hand them out at competitions. Usually they have around 2 to 3 people working on buttons to make the process go by faster! Something else they have been working on is the sponsor board logo stickers, so they can be put on the robot. Along with that they also wrote a thank you letter and figured out the logistics of the ride situation for our next competition.
