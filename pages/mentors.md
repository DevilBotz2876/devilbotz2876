      <strong>Arshad Khan</strong> serves not only as 2876's Head Mentor, but also as a math teacher here at <em>Burlington High School</em>. When he's not busy posing for the camera or creating lesson plans for his motley calculus, geometry, and algebra classes, Arshad facilitates the club's business endeavors, creates regular meeting agendas, and assists the mechanical team with their daily tasks. Arshad also takes care of buying new parts and re-supplying our team's limited stocks whenever necessary. Zealous about Robotics and even more enthusiastic about instructing, Arshad taught an "Introduction to Robotics" course for the first time in 2015-16. This course, offered as an elective to all grades, serves to inspire the next generation of robot-enthusiasts.

    <div><strong>Maciej Wiczynski</strong> has been our programming team's Head Mentor ever since 2876's first few days. With his extensive knowledge of Java and his years of experience working for <em>Oracle</em>, Mr. Wiczynski is undoubtedly an integral asset to our club. Passionate yet methodical, Mr. Wiczynski is usually the first to bring the entire club together to discuss specific details regarding prototyping, driving, and finally constructing our robot. Mr. Wiczynski cares deeply about the process taken to get to a final answer; getting the correct answer simply does not cut it for him. His unique style revolves around empowering his mentees: whenever they are presented with a formidable challenge (such as a bug in the code), he lets them experiment and attempt to solve the problem themselves before chiming in with one of his many helpful hints.</div>

He was also instrumental in the hardware design for MIT's 2000 6.270 Autonomous Robot Design Competition's robot kit (BotKit). Mr. Agarwalla shares the mentoring team's philosophy of focusing on "the process" and making sure the students do not settle for just the "what," but also understand the "how" and the "why."</div>

She has also started designing small PCBs. Mentor Chris Morse recruited her after they both worked at a drone company. Ms Roth previously worked on Stretch at <em>Boston Dynamics</em> and a medical robot at <em>Vicarious Surgical</em>. She enjoys R&D because she gets to help engineers work through prototypes and iterations until there is a final product to toss over the fence to manufacturing/production -- then she gets to start on something new again!</p>
