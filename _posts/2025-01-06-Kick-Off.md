The 2025 FIRST Robotics season has officially started! On January 4th, 2025 we had our Kick-Off, a meeting where the whole team gets together to watch FIRST announce the challenge for this year: **Reefscape&trade;**. This year's challenge is based on strengthening the earth's underwater ecosystem.

Unlike last year's competition when robots had to shoot Notes into tall structures called Speakers, this year the main way to score points is by placing Coral (short lengths of PVC) on the Reef (a tall structure with various branches). Of course, this is just one way to score points. Our team is working on the best possible strategies to strengthen our chances of winning. Fortunately, we have had many new members join with their unique ideas! We're excited to see what this year's challenge and team members have to offer. This year our team has icreases in a significant amount amount of about 15 students!

Make sure to check in next week for a new update!
