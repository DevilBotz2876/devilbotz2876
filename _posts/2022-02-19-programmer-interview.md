*What is your background in Computer Science and programming?*

_Parker_- I have been interested in CS since a very young age which has caused me to pursue cs as a class. I'm a self taught full stack developer with experience in Java, Express, Node.js, HTML, CSS, Python, and C#. 

_Adi_- I've been mostly learning from BHS but I did attend CS classes in Java which I have also learned from my dad. I have also taught myself Swift. 
 

*What have you been working on this season?*

_Parker_- Currently, I am working on integrating sub-systems with a friendly interface to make the drivers and technical teams jobs easier.

_Adi_- I've been working on a diagnostic tab which can diagnose any main issues in the robot and get information about... (?)
 

*Which mentors have you worked with and what have they taught you?*

_Adi_- I've been working with Maciej and Rekha and they are teaching me how to code different elements of the program and how to use the software. 
 

*What do you think you need to improve on?*

_Adi_- I need to become more confident in my coding.
 

*What are you looking forward to for the next build season?*

_Parker_- I am looking forward to working with new and exciting hardware to excite the minds of students interested in STEAM.

_Adi_- I am looking forward to learning a lot of new programming.
 

*What have been some hardships so far?*

_Parker_- Some challenges that we have faced this year are bugs with the robot codes, including veering and jittering with the robot. 

_Adi_- Some hardships were importing packages and classes into the robot code and vendor dependencies. 


*What are you hoping will happen in the upcoming competitions?*

_Parker_- That the robot code works smoothly and runs with quality during the competition. 

_Adi_- I hope we do well and nothing goes wrong. 
 

*What are you hoping comes to the team next year?*

_Parker_- A mix of new and experienced members to the team and continued learning across the summer break.
