        <p>When The Home Depot was founded in 1978, Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank had no idea how revolutionary this new "hardware store" would be for home improvement and the retail industry.</p>

        <p>Today, we're proud to be the world's largest home improvement retailer. In 2,300 stores across North America, we aspire to excel in service -- to our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. That's what leadership means to us. That's The Home Depot difference.</p>

        <p>Today, The Home Depot is the world's largest home improvement retailer with approximately 500,000 orange-blooded associates and 2,300 stores in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The typical store today averages 105,000 square feet of indoor retail space, interconnected with an e-commerce business that offers more than one million products for the DIY customer, professional contractors, and the industry's largest installation business for the Do-It-For-Me customer.</p>

        <p>We are your local hardware store and we are a part of your community. Ace Hardware has over 5,000 stores around the world with the majority of those stores independently owned and operated by local entrepreneurs. These hard working men and women are part of the fabric of your community. They are small business owners who are local and loyal...just like it ought to be. While others have become large and impersonal, at Ace, we've remained small and very personal. That's why we say a visit to Ace, is like a visit to your neighbor.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1924 by a small group of Chicago hardware store owners, Ace changed the retail landscape by allowing individual stores to purchase merchandise in bulk to save money and buy at the lowest possible price. This partnership enabled even the smaller stores to compete effectively at retail despite larger stores in their market. And to this very day, Ace Hardware Corporation is still owned solely and exclusively by the local Ace retail entrepreneurs.</p>
