There is less than one month before the offical FIRST Robotics competition seasons starts! Right now everyone is working so hard to get back into the flow. To help new members understand how FIRST competitions work, we've created a mini-robot challenge using Romi [https://www.pololu.com/product/4022]. Once the official season starts they will be able to contribute as much as possible. 

We've recently gotten a new drive system called Swerve [https://www.freshconsulting.com/insights/blog/how-to-build-a-swerve-drive-robot/] and are currently learning how to use it. It’s been a fun experience learning how new technology works and this will benefit us a lot. The business team has also been working hard trying to find food donations and discovering new ways to fundraise for our team. Once the official competition season starts, more blogs will be coming your way!
