With the competition approaching, each team is making sure they are doing their part to help the team and finish the robot. The CAD team is currently designing the lift motor for the algae handler and creating the energy chain for the elevator which carries the wires that power part of the robot such as the arm and algae intake. The mechanical team is currently building the elevator, specifically the parts that mount onto the robot. They are also redesigning our marquee sign for the pit. The programming team is bringing the sub parts to life by coding the arm, climber, etc.. The business team is making sure hotels are booked, meme buttons are made, and everyone's fed. They are also making sure everyone is up to date with what is happening with the team by posting blogs and on instagram such as this one!
