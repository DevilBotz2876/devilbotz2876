As the final two weeks come around, we are in a full grind mode, non stop. Since last month, yes last month, we have built 2 robots! One is our practice bot and the other is our main bot. The final touches are being added on today along with the drive team, and programming getting ready for practice. The agenda is as follows for the next week onto tournament : We have Monday and Tuesday of next week to get the robot built. Then we can no longer build the robot but practice won;t stop till tournament day!!

We are very excited for the upcoming few weeks and hope that you&#8217;ll be there to join us during the tournament!!

Thanks,<br />
