Today, the members of the Business team have worked hard to accomplish their goals. With competition just around the corner, the Business team has been working on various project and tasks to help prepare the team for competition.

One of the more important tasks the business team handled was making Meme Buttons! Making these buttons is a big part of expressing the less serious and silly side of our team. Each year they make new meme buttons designs and spend a few weeks making them to be handed out at competitions. Since team work makes the dream work, around 2 to 3 people work on buttons to make the process go by faster. Another task they've been working on is the sponsor logo stickers, which are then put on the robot. To thank all of our generous sponsors, they also wrote letters to them, detailing how the sponsorships have helped the team. Lastly, to ensure we see everyone at competition, the business team figured out the logistics of rides to and from the competitions. We're excited to meet everyone at Revere!
