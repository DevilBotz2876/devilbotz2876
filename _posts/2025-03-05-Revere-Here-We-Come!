One of the more important tasks the business team handled was making Meme Buttons! Making these buttons is a big part of expressing the less serious and silly side of our team. Each year they create new meme buttons designs and spend a few weeks constructing them to be handed out at competitions. Since teamwork makes the dream work, around two to three people work on buttons to make the process go by faster. Another task they've been working on is the sponsor logo stickers, which are put on the robot. To thank all of our generous sponsors, the business team also wrote letters to them, detailing how the sponsorships have helped the team. Lastly, to ensure we see everyone at competition, the business team figured out the logistics of rides to and from the competitions. We're excited to meet everyone at Revere!
