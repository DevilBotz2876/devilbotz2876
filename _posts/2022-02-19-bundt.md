Today was the last Saturday meeting of the build season! The team worked hard and we're looking forward to our first competition in Reading on March 18th. We met with a new partner, _Nothing Bundt Cakes_. Ricky was a very kind guy and helped us immediately. The place was very cozy and beautiful and the cakes were even better. Next, we went to _Regina Pizzeria_ and grabbed some delicious cheese pizza. We worked with a lot of different places this season, and we hope to continue next year!
