About three weeks ago our team competed in our first competition for this season in Revere! During the competition Mechanical team worked closely with members of Pit crew and a few Software people to enusre the robot was functioning properly.

After each match Pit crew would conduct a check to make sure every part of the robot worked. Software team spentt the majorirty of the time fixing small bugs that seeped through the develpment. They also helped Pit crew find any problems. Pit crew also runs a check on the robot and makes sure everything is connected, along with testing the parts of the robot that move such as the climbers and the elevator. A big part of competiton is scouting. Which is when someone takes a look at a robot and determines how well it does based on points scored and algae and coral, then you give them a star rating. This process is done for 1 robot each round but there are multiple people scouting so an entire allaince can be covered. During competition Business team mainly worked on managing the food sitation and posting on social media.
