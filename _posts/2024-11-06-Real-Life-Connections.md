Our new favorite team-building activity: Real Life Connections. For those who don't know Connections, it's a game made by the New York Times. The original game consists of 16 separate words which are grouped by the player into four categories that have something in common. The categories can be anything from capital cities to words that simply rhyme. The player must decide which words on their screen should be sorted into which categories. The player has four tries to complete this puzzle. If more than four mistakes are made, the game will end and the categories will reveal themselves.

Our real-life version of the NYT online game had the same idea, but of course we made a few changes. First, similar to the online game, we made four categories: Sharp Objects, Decorative Items, Stationary Items, and Mini Objects. From there, we found objects that fit into the categories, such as school supplies, desk ornaments, and Barbie accessories. We added all these objects into five shoeboxes and handed out the boxes to the five teams (each team had about 6-7 people). In 15 minutes, teams had to sort out the objects. During this time, members of the business team walked around the room assisting any team that wanted us to check their answers or needed hints. By the end of the activity, two teams had all the connections Congrats to them! 

Stay tuned for more activities!!
